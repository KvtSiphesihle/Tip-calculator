1. Understanding DOM Manipulation
The code demonstrates how to interact with HTML elements using JavaScript.

2. Event Handling
While the code does not show event listeners explicitly, functions like increasePeople and decreasePeople are likely tied to button clicks.

3. Basic Arithmetic and Number Formatting
The code calculates the total bill with a tip and splits it among a group of people.

4. Conditional Logic
The decreasePeople function uses a conditional statement to prevent the number of people from dropping below 1, showing an alert if the user attempts this.

5. Encapsulation and Function Design
The code encapsulates functionality into discrete functions (calculateBill, increasePeople, decreasePeople).

6. Dynamic Updates
Functions like calculateBill and increasePeople ensure the UI updates dynamically based on user input or interactions.

7. Error Prevention
The alert in decreasePeople prevents the application from encountering a division by zero error by ensuring peoplewegot never drops below 1.
